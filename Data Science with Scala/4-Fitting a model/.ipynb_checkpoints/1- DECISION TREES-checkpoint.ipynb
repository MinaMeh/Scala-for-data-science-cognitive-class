    "## Decision Trees \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is an effective non-parametric modeling method for different types of data. It can handle both continuous and categorical data. It can also help us identify markers that split our categories. \n",

    "* Popular method for classification and regression\n",
    "* Easy to interoret\n",
    "* Handle categorical features\n",

    "## MLlib's implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "MLlib's implementation of Decision Trees supports both binary and multi-class classification as well as regression. It also supports both continuous and categorical features. In MLlib the data is partitioned by rows allowing distributed training of Decision Trees. \n",

    "* Supports binary and multiclass classification\n",

    "* Supports continuous and categorical features \n",
    "* Partitions data by rows, allowing distributed training\n",

    "* More functionalities in the original MLlib API \n",
    "* Separation of Decision Trees for classification and regression\n",

    "## Inputs and Outputs \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take a look at the inputs taken and the output produced by decision trees in the Pipelines API. As inputs, there are the label and feature columns. If its corresponding parameter names are omitted the API will look for its defaults, label and features in the import DataFrame. As outputs there are the prediction, rawPrediction and probability columns, where the last two only apply for classification trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "If its corresponding parameter names are omitted the API will append these columns with its default names to the resulting DataFrame.\n",

    "\n",
    "`numClasses`, the number of classes in a classification problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "`categoricalFeaturesInfo` is an optional parameter that specifies which features are categorical and how many categorical values each of those features can take.  Although it is an optional parameter, if specified properly it can lead to better performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Stopping Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine when the tree stops building\n",
    "* May lead to overfitting\n",
    "* Need to be validate on held-out test data\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters in the stopping criteria category determine when the tree stops building. The specification of these parameters need to be validated on held-out test data, as they may lead to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Stopping Criteria, Parameters \n",
    "\n",
    "* `maxDepth`: maximum depth of a tree\n",
    "\t* if it increases (deeper trees):\n",
    "\t\t* more expressive, potentially higher accuracy\n",
    "\t\t* more costly to train\n",
    "\t\t* more likely to overfit\n",
    "* `minInstancesPerNode`: each child must receive at least this number of instances for a node to be split further\n",
    "\t* commonly used in Random Forests as its trees are deeper and may overfit\n",
    "* `minInfoGain`: the split must improve this much, in terms of information gain, for a node to be split further\n",
    "\t* The information gain is the difference between the parent node impurity and the weighted sum of the two child node impurities\n",
    "\t* Node impurity is a measure of the homogeniety of the labels at the node\n",
    "\n",
    "This category of parameters include: `maxDepth`, the maximum depth of the tree. If this parameter is increased, that is, if it is set to build deeper trees, the resulting model may be more expressive and more accurate, but will also be more costly to train and more likely to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "`minInstancesPerNode`, the minimum number of instances the children node must receive for a node to be split further. It is commonly used in Random Forests; as trees go deeper and may overfit, resulting leaf nodes with only one instance each.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`minInfoGain`, the minimum information gain obtained with a split for the node to be split further. The information gain is the difference between the parent node impurity and the weighted sum the two child nodes' impurities. The impurity of a node is a measure of the homogeneity of the labels at that particular node.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tunable Parameters I\n",
    "\n",
    "* `maxBins`: number of bins used when discretizing continuous features\n",
    "\t* must be at least the maximum number of categories for any categorical feature\n",
    "\t* if it increases: \n",
    "\t\t* allows the consideration of more split candidates and fine-grained split decisions\n",
    "\t\t* increases computation and communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the tunable parameters. As their name suggests these are parameters for fine-tuning a model and they also need to be validated on held-out test data as they, too, may lead to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This final category of parameters include: maxBins; the number of bins used when discretizing continuous features, being equal or greater than the maximum number of categories for any categorical feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tunable Parameters II\n",
    "\n",
    "* `maxMemoryInMB`: amount of memory to be used for collecting sufficient statistics\n",
    "\t* default = 256 MB, works in most scenarios\n",
    "\t* if it increases: \n",
    "\t\t* can lead to faster training by allowing fewer passes over the data\n",
    "\t\t* there may be decreasing returns since amount of communication on each interaction also increases\n",
    "\n",
    "`maxMemoryInMB`: the amount of memory to be used for collecting sufficient statistics. Its default stands at 256 megabytes which will work in most scenarios. If increased, this parameter can lead to faster training, since it allows fewer passes over the data. On the other hand, if increased too much, it may have decreasing returns as the amount of communication on each interaction also increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tunable Parameters III\n",
    "\n",
    "* `subsamplingRate`: fraction of the training data used for learning the decision tree\n",
    "\t* more relevant for training ensemblers of trees (see next Lesson)\n",
    "* `impurity`: impurity measure used to choose between candidate splits\n",
    "\t* classification: Gini Impurity and Entropy\n",
    "\t* regression: Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "`subSamplingRate`, the fraction of the training data used for learning the decision trade. This parameter is more relevant for training ensembles of trees like Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impurity`, the impurity measure used to choose between candidate splits. For classification problems, Gini Impurity and Entropy measures are supported. For regression problems the only supported measure is the Variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Summary\n",
    "\n",
