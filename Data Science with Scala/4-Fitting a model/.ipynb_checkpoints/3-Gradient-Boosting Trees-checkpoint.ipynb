    "\n",
    "Welcome to Gradient-Boosting Trees (GBTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this set of lessons about Predicting Grant Applications, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand how to fit together the functions available in Spark's machine learning libraries to solve real problems\n",
    "* Use a spark cluster to fit models in a fraction of the time\n",
    "* Perform classification and regression with Gradient-Boosted Trees\n",
    "* Understand and use Gradient-Boosted Trees parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient-Boosting Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "* Like Random Forests, they are ensembles of decision trees\n",
    "* Iteratively trained to minimize a loss function\n",
    "* Supports binary classification\n",
    "* Supports regression\n",
    "* Supports continuous and categorical features\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pipelines API for gradient boosted trees supports regression and binary classification it also supports continuous and categorical features.\n",
    "This is a quick description of the basic algorithm of Gradient-Boosted Trees:\n",
    "* Iteratively trains a sequence of decision trees\n",
    "* On each iteration it uses the current ensemble to make label predictions and then it compares these to true labels\n",
    "* Next it re-labels the dataset to put more emphasis on instances with poor predictions, according to a given loss function\n",
    "* With each iteration it reduces the loss function, thus correcting for previous mistakes\n",
    "* Supported loss functions:\n",
    "  * `classification`: Log Loss (twice binomial negative log likelihood)\n",
    "  * `regression`: Squared Error (L2 loss, default) and Absolute Error (L1 loss, more robust to outliers)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient-Boosted Trees Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* `loss`: loss function (Log Loss, for classification, Squared and Absolute errors, for regression)\n",
    "* `numIterations`: number of trees in the ensemble\n",
    "   * each iteration produces one tree\n",
    "    * if it increases:\n",
    "        * model gets more expressive, improving training data accuracy\n",
    "        * test-time accuracy may suffer (if too large)\n",
    " * `learningRate`: should NOT need to be tuned\n",
    "    * if behaviour seems unstable, decreasing it may improve stability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation While Training\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gradient-Boosted Trees can overfit when trained with more trees\n",
    "* The method `runWithValidation` allows validation while training\n",
    "  * takes a pair of RDDs: training and validation datasets\n",
    "* Training is stopped when validation error improvement is less than the tolerance specified as `validationTol`in `BoostingStrategy`\n",
    "  * validation error decreases initially and later increases\n",
    "  * there might be cases in which the validation error does not change monotonically\n",
    "    * set a large enough negative tolerance\n",
    "    * examine validation curve using `evaluateEachIteration`, which gives the error or loss per iteration\n",
    "    * tune the number of iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs & Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO table screenshot**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have inputs and outputs. The inputs taken by Gradient-Boosted Trees in the Pipelines API are just the same as the inputs taken by Decision Trees, that is, the label and features columns. However, Gradient-Boosted Trees output only one column, the prediction itself.\n",
